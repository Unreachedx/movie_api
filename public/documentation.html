Hi all i just wanted to say this is going to be my first Backend API im building from scratch so there is not all to much to see and read at this point, the title gona be "Movie API" thats all i know for now
I know started to build the API and i have a few endpoints that are working.
I am just starting to incorperate Express, and some other packages to make the API more accessible.
